📊 EpiClim Insights (2009–2023) – Power BI Dashboard
🌟 Overview

This project is part of my journey to master data visualization tools — specifically Power BI.
As a data science student, I often hear how important visualization is in telling meaningful stories from data.
So, I decided to put this into practice by working on a real dataset and building a complete interactive dashboard.

📂 Dataset Used

I used the EpiClim dataset (2009–2023) which contains:

Weekly district-level epidemic data across India (Dengue, Malaria, Cholera, Chikungunya, etc.)

Climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, and vegetation index

Data from hundreds of districts over 15+ years, making it perfect for time-series analysis

This dataset is ideal for analyzing:

✅ Outbreak trends over the years

✅ Geographical spread of diseases

✅ Seasonal patterns (month-wise variations)

✅ Climate-health correlations

🎯 What I Built

Using Power BI, I designed an interactive dashboard that includes:

KPI Cards:

Total Cases

Total Deaths

Line Chart:

Deaths by Year – to show long-term trends

Donut Charts:

Cases by Disease

Deaths by Disease

Cases by Month – to highlight seasonal peaks

Bar Chart:

Count of Districts by Disease – ranking which diseases are widespread

Table View:

Year-wise breakdown of diseases and deaths

Slicer Panel:

Allows filtering by state to view region-specific insights

🎨 Why This Dashboard Matters

This dashboard makes it easy to understand outbreaks and climate patterns, even for a non-technical audience.
Instead of reading through thousands of rows of raw data, you can now:

Quickly see which disease is most prevalent

Identify peak outbreak years

Spot seasonal patterns and possible correlations with climate factors

Filter by state to focus on regional insights

🛠️ Skills & Tools Used

Power BI: Data cleaning, modeling, KPIs, slicers, interactive charts

Data Analysis: Identifying trends, summarizing key metrics

Storytelling: Designing visuals that are easy to interpret
