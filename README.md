# Data Visualization - POWERBI Report
🔍 What I Built

Using Power BI, I created a dashboard that shows:
✅ Total Cases & Deaths (KPIs at the top)
📅 Trend over the years (Deaths by year line chart)
🏥 Cases by Disease (Donut chart to compare proportions)
🧾 Deaths by Disease (Donut chart)
📆 Cases by Month (Seasonality insight)
🎛️ State-level slicer to filter results interactively

🎯 Key Takeaways

This dashboard helps visualize outbreaks & climate trends clearly.

Anyone can instantly spot which diseases are most frequent, which states are most affected, and when outbreaks peak.

It’s a great way to convert complex datasets into simple, actionable insights.

💡 This project boosted my data storytelling skills and gave me hands-on experience with Power BI slicers, filters, KPIs, and visuals.
